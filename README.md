# Simple Shell Project - Holberton Software School.

### Project details
-----
Simple Shell is a program that can be launched from the command line within any number of Linux versions. It contains the most basic features and functions found in the various shell programs on UNIX-like operating systems e.g. Linux.


### Background
-----
The Simple Shell project is a major team project conducted by Mohamed Ladhari and Andrew Godwin, both students at Holberton Software School. It is for educational purposes. It consists of developing and makng our own version of the shell found in several versions of Linux. Though cloning of the shell was the general guidance, having the same exact functionalities and rich features as the original was not the goal. The goal for us was to learn and develop various team and individual skills regarding peer coding, collaboration on projects, the use of web-based/hosted Git repository hosting service e.g. Github and the use of version control systems e.g. git.

### Quick Start
-----
1. Github or Git clone this respository to your local directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pasignature/simple_shell.git
```
2. Compile the program.
```
$ make all
```
3. Execute the shell.
```
$ ./hsh
```
Note: You can also run this shell in non-interactive mode, by simply piping your desired commands into the shell executable.
